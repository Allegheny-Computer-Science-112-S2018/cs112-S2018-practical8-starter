# cs112-S2018-practical8-starter

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Practical 8 in Computer Science 112. Since
the Travis builds for this repository will initially fail (as evidenced by a
red &#x2717; appearing in the commit logs instead of a green &#x2714;), the
programmer is responsible for completing all of the steps needed to satisfy the
requirements for the assignment, thus causing a &#x2714; to instead appear in
the commit logs.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to understand the methods in a `WordCount`
program that is inspired by the source code segment in Section 10.1.2 of the
textbook. With that said, the provided source code combines the `Tree` and and
`HashMap` data structures to implement a more comprehensive solution. Your job
for this assignment is to run the program and study its output. Then, you are
responsible for adding comments to the source code that demonstrate you
understand how the `WordCount` program uses both a `Tree` and a `HashMap` to
produce the expected output. Finally, as verified by
[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle), the source code for
all of the Java classes must adhere to all of the requirements in the [Google
Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

When you use the `git commit` command to transfer your source code to your
GitHub repository, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) will initialize a build
of your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both
your source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you
will see a green &#x2714; in the listing of commits in GitHub. If your
submission does not meet the requirements, a red &#x2717; will appear instead.
The instructor will reduce a programmer's grade for this assignment if the red
&#x2717; appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of
laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these
guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

Please read all of the content and study all of the technical diagrams and
source code segments in Sections 8.1 through 8.3 and 10.1 through 10.2. Finally,
please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if
you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

## Commands

To get started in using the GatorGrader tool, you can change into the directory
for this assignment and type the command `./gatorgrader.sh --start` in your
terminal. Now, if you want to perform all of the checks that will automatically
evaluate your assignment, you can type the command `./gatorgrader.sh --check`.

Running this command will produce a lot of output that you should carefully
inspect. If the last line of the output indicates that GatorGrader judges that
there are no mistakes in the assignment, then this means that your source code
and writing are passing all of the automated checks. However, if the last line
of the output indicates that there are mistakes, then you will need to
understand what they are and then try to fix them.

You can also complete several important Java programming tasks by using the
`gradle` tool. For instance, you can compile (i.e., create bytecode from the
program's source code if it is a correct program) the program using the command
`gradle build`. There are also additional commands that you can type:

- `gradle clean`: clean the project of all the derived files
- `gradle check`: check the quality of the code using Checkstyle
- `gradle build`: create the bytecode from the Java source code
- `gradle run`: run the Java program in the command-line
- `gradle tasks`: display details about the Gradle system

To run one of these commands, you must be in the home directory for this
assignment where the `build.gradle` file is located. Then, you can type the
command in the terminal and study the output.

If the course instructor publishes a new version of GatorGrader and asks you to
access it, then you need change into the tool's directory by typing `cd
gatorgrader`. Then, you can type the command `git pull` to download the new
source code for the GatorGrader tool. If this command completes successfully,
then you can return to the main directory for this practical assignment by
typing `cd ..` and then continuing your work.

## Output

Instead of running an experiment, the `WordCount` program reads in a file and
then uses a combination of the `Tree` and `HashMap` data structures to analyze
the words that are in the file. The following output illustrates how the
specialize type of `HashMap` stores and outputs the key-value pairs associated
with the words and their word-count frequencies. Instead of asking you to write
code to produce this output, the assignment requires you to add comments to the
source code to demonstrate that you understand how the program works.

## Checking

Since this assignment asks you to write comments to explain an existing source
code segment, the checks for the practical will be performed directly by the
course instructor. You will receive the checkmark grade for this practical
assignment if your source code builds correctly, it produces the same output as
is given in the assignment sheet, and it has thoughtful comments that correctly
explain how each source code segment works.

## Updates

If the course instructor updates the provided material for this assignment and
you would like to receive these updates, then you can type this command in the
main directory for this assignment:

```
./gatorgrader.sh --update git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-112-S2018/cs112-S2018-practical8-starter.git
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
./gatorgrader.sh --download
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide
you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor or a teaching assistant.

## Travis

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
the checking programs every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The
checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment, thus creating
your own private repository, and the course instructor enables Travis for it. If
you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize Travis CI to
access the private repositories that you created on GitHub.

## Requirements

The GatorGrader software that supports the checking of this assignment was
developed for the following software and versions:

- gradle 4.1
- java 1.8.0
- junit 4.9.0
- mdl 0.4.0
- proselint 0.7.0
- python 3.5.2
